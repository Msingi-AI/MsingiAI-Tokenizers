# Introduction to Tokenization  

Tokenization is one of the most fundamental steps in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It involves breaking down text into smaller units, such as words, subwords, or characters, which serve as the building blocks for machine learning models to process and understand language.  


## Why is Tokenization Important?  

1. **Simplifies Text Representation**: Machines process numbers, not text. Tokenization converts text into numerical representations that models can use.  
2. **Preserves Meaning**: Tokenization retains linguistic information while reducing text into manageable units.  
3. **Adapts to Language Structure**: Different languages require different approaches to tokenization, especially when handling complex grammar, morphology, or syntax.  

## Types of Tokenization  

### 1. **Word Tokenization**  
Breaks text into individual words.  
- Example:  
  **Input**: "Welcome to MsingiAI!"  
  **Output**: ["Welcome", "to", "MsingiAI", "!"]  

### 2. **Subword Tokenization**  
Splits words into smaller meaningful units, especially useful for handling unknown or rare words. Commonly used in models like BERT and GPT.  
- Example:  
  **Input**: "unhappiness"  
  **Output**: ["un", "happiness"]  

### 3. **Character Tokenization**  
Treats each character as a token, helpful for languages with complex word forms.  
- Example:  
  **Input**: "NLP"  
  **Output**: ["N", "L", "P"]  


## Challenges in Tokenization for African Languages  

African languages present unique challenges in tokenization due to their:  

1. **Agglutinative and Inflectional Morphology**:  
   - Example: In Kiswahili, "nikupenda" means "I love you," but it is a combination of several morphemes:  
     - *ni* (I)  
     - *ku* (you)  
     - *penda* (love)  

2. **Code-Switching**:  
   - Example: "Nimebook ticket online" (Swahili-English mix). Tokenizers must handle mixed-language sentences effectively.  

3. **Tonal Variations**:  
   - In some languages like Yoruba, tone changes the meaning of words. Example:  
     - "Ọkà" (corn) vs. "Ọ̀kà" (python).  

4. **Non-Standardized Orthography**:  
   - Many African languages lack a single, widely accepted writing system, leading to inconsistencies in tokenization.  


## Tokenization Approaches  

1. **Rule-Based Tokenization**  
   Relies on language-specific rules, such as whitespace and punctuation splitting.  
   - Pros: Simple and interpretable.  
   - Cons: Struggles with complex morphology.  

2. **Statistical Tokenization**  
   Learns tokenization rules from a corpus of text using probabilistic methods.  

3. **Neural Tokenization**  
   Utilizes machine learning models to predict the optimal way to tokenize text based on context.  


## Tokenization in the Context of African NLP  

For African languages, tokenization must:  
1. **Respect Linguistic Structures**: Consider agglutinative and tonal features.  
2. **Handle Multilingual Texts**: Be robust to code-switching.  
3. **Adapt to Low-Resource Settings**: Work effectively even when training data is limited.  


## Tokenization Tools  

Here are some commonly used tokenization libraries:  

1. **[NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)**: Python library with simple tokenization utilities.  
2. **[spaCy](https://spacy.io/)**: Offers pre-built tokenizers for several languages.  
3. **[Hugging Face Tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/)**: Fast and customizable tokenization for NLP models.  
4. **[Mecab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/)**: Popular for tokenizing Japanese but can be adapted for other languages.  


## Conclusion  

Tokenization is foundational to NLP and especially critical for African languages due to their unique linguistic features. This repository aims to tackle these challenges and provide tailored tokenization solutions that empower the next generation of African NLP applications.
