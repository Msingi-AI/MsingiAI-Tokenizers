# MsingiAI Tokenizers 

### Building Tokenization Tools for African Languages  

Welcome to the **MsingiAI Tokenizers Repository**! This is a community-driven initiative to develop **high-quality tokenizers** for African languages, which are currently underserved in the world of natural language processing (NLP). By building tokenizers specifically tailored to the linguistic structure and diversity of African languages, we aim to lay a strong foundation for advancing NLP research and applications across the continent.  

##  Why This Matters  

Africa is one of the most linguistically diverse regions in the world, with over 2,000 languages. Unfortunately, many of these languages lack the basic computational tools necessary for natural language processing tasks.  

Tokenization is one of the most fundamental tasks in NLP. However, tokenizers designed for widely spoken languages like English, French, or Chinese often fail to account for:  

- **Complex Morphology**: Many African languages are highly agglutinative, where words are formed by combining multiple morphemes.  
- **Tonal Systems**: Tone can alter the meaning of words in some languages, but it is often ignored by existing tools.  
- **Lack of Standardized Orthography**: Some African languages lack standardized writing systems, making tokenization more challenging.  
- **Multilingual Contexts**: Many African speakers mix multiple languages, often within the same sentence (code-switching).  

By addressing these challenges, we aim to empower researchers, developers, and communities to build tools that reflect the true richness of African languages.  

## 🎯 Project Objectives  

1. **Develop Tokenizers**: Build tokenizers for as many African languages as possible, tailored to their unique linguistic features.  
2. **Provide Benchmarks**: Establish evaluation frameworks for tokenizers to measure their accuracy and performance.  
3. **Create Reusable Tools**: Provide easy-to-use libraries and APIs for African language tokenization.  
4. **Foster Collaboration**: Build a community of contributors passionate about African NLP.  

## Key Features  

- **Language-Specific Tokenizers**: Tokenization tools optimized for individual African languages or language families.  
- **Support for Code-Switching**: Handling multilingual text and mixed-language sentences.  
- **Preprocessing Utilities**: Tools for text normalization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal.  
- **Open-Source and Extensible**: Contributions are welcome, and the tools will remain free and open for all.

## 🔍 Getting Started  

### Installation  

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/msingi-ai/msingi-tokenizers.git  
cd msingi-tokenizers

### Example Usage  

Here’s an example of using a tokenizer:  

```python  
from tokenizers.swahili_tokenizer import SwahiliTokenizer  

# Initialize the tokenizer  
tokenizer = SwahiliTokenizer()  

# Tokenize text  
text = "Jambo, karibu MsingiAI!"  
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)  
print(tokens)  
```
